# Basic Rules:
# Terms Of Service:

- Personal insults and/or verbal attacks outside of specific role play situations and all forms of harassment are prohibited and will result in a ban.


- Racism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Sexism, Hate Speech, and all forms of targeted, derogatory, or abusive language will not be tolerated and will result in a permanent ban.

# Community Policies:


- Should disagreements or instances of rule-breaking occur in the game, all members should attempt to roleplay through them without breaking character. Once the scene is completed, members may then send in reports to staff. If the issue is urgent and must be dealt with immediately, such as a Zero Tolerance rule break, you may open a ticket to report the issue.

- If staff deems the overall quality of roleplay subpar or inconsistent with the server's goals and values, you may be placed under evaluation by staff. If your in-character conduct is deemed detrimental to the overall quality of roleplay, you may be subject to disciplinary action, or removal from the server entirely. 

- All weapons are lethal. This means that all weapon interactions (shooting, stabbing, throwing, etc.) have consequences and must be handled in character as if they are real. 

- The utilization of glitches, exploits, hacks, or bugs for personal gain will result in disciplinary action. There is a zero tolerance for hacking, including but not limited to script/resource injection, and will result in a permanent ban. If you find a glitch or in-game exploit please notify the staff team via opening a ticket.

- Third party crosshairs are not allowed in duels

- Suicide roleplay or self-harm roleplay of any kind is not tolerated and will result in a permanent ban.


# General Rules: 

- Our ruleset is intended to be clear while encouraging roleplay between players. If you suspect a rule to have been broken mid-scene, wait until the scene concludes then open a ticket.

- You are expected to remain in character and not talk ooc the entire time you are logged into the server.

- While in character, all communication must remain within the server at all times to ensure immersion and consistency. You may not be in a third party voice call with anyone who is currently in server. The only exception is participating in calls with individuals who are not part of the server, as this does not interfere with in-server interactions

- Staff is dedicated to providing a positive and enjoyable experience for everyone within the community.
 
- Rules as written and rules as intended are both valid aspects that staff will consider during any disciplinary action in regard to any rule, policy,  or rule enforcement.



# Roleplay over Gunplay:

## Low-Tier Initiation is Considered RDM

- Any "low-tier initiation"—defined as shooting firearms or using weapons with force without meaningful dialogue or interaction—will be classified as RDM (Random Deathmatch).

## Examples of Low-Tier Initiation (RDM):

--A player walks up to someone and shoots them without prior roleplay.


- A player stabs another without speaking or giving any roleplay context.


- A player fires at someone immediately after saying a single vague line like "You messed up" without further interaction.


- A group ambushes another with weapons and opens fire without any verbal warning or attempt at roleplay.


## What Is NOT Considered RDM:

- A player draws their gun and aims it at another in a robbery, giving clear demands (e.g., "Hands up and don’t try anything, or you’ll regret it.").


- A character uses a weapon to threaten or intimidate someone without firing (e.g., pressing a gun against someone’s back and saying, "Let’s take a walk.").


- A conflict escalates naturally through roleplay before violence occurs (e.g., an argument turns into a physical fight, and only after further escalation does a gun get drawn and fired).


- A player shoots in self-defense after another character threatens or initiates violence against them first, only when there is opportunity to do so (guns are lowered).


## Clarification on Gunplay:

- Gunplay should not be the first method of conflict resolution. Characters should attempt meaningful roleplay interactions before resorting to violence, ensuring depth in character interactions and storytelling.


- Roleplay over Rules - This means that you should maintain your RP to be as immersive as possible even in the face of rule breaks


## Character Guidelines

- Characters must be 18+, Players must be 18+.
 

- Character Names must be realistic for the time period. Names are forbidden from being Historical Character names, Famous Names, Television/Movie Character names, or names relating to Meme Culture/Pop Culture. Names that also are a reference or combination to names falling into the aforementioned categories is also against the rules.


- All names should strive to be unique and avoid having the same name as another active player.


- You must be in character on the server at all times. Roleplay through the encounters in front of you. If there is a rule break report it AFTER the scenario has completed. (This does not pertain to major rule breaks like hacking, racism, sexual abuse, or major harassment).


- If you intend to engage in hostile RP (eg. robbing) it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you record using Medal or some other platform in case your scene becomes involved in a ticket with a rule break in question.

 
# Discord Rules:

- Abide by the Discord TOS: https://discord.com/terms


- BE KIND to staff and to each other in Discord and in Tickets.


- Change your Discord name to have your Character’s First and Last name.
 

- Don’t DM staff regarding rules or game related issues, open a ticket. Any advice given by staff in DMs is personal opinions, and not to be regarded as permission in any capacity if later brought into question.
 

- Don't talk negatively about other servers and players.


- No NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
 

- Players may disagree with staff, but MUST respect decisions when they are made and conduct conversation in a manner that shows respect.

 
# Zero Tolerance Rules: 

- No coordinating IC events OOC. This can all be done IC. ANYTHING that would persuade your actions IC, including where you go, who you meet up with, what you are preparing to do is META.


- Suicide RP, including any threats or harassing comments in the discord is not allowed.
 

- No Hate speech of any kind
 

- No racism/sexism/homophobia/transphobia/rape
 

- No use of N or R words, among others.
 

- Sexual Abuse & Domestic Abuse and/or claims thereof on an In Character Level are off limits due to OOC triggers
 

- Sharing Items or Money between your own characters for any reason is prohibited


- Child murder/torture, or even threats of such, are never allowed even when still in the womb. For more information, see “Pregnancy RP and Aging”


- Using macros to fish, mine, craft, or anything else while AFK, or even while IC is powergaming. Do not do this. 

 
# Communication Standards:

 
- We are an English-speaking server, you must be able to speak English to play here.


- Saying words/phrases in a different language for RP effect is acceptable, but if someone asks you what you were saying, please repeat the word/phrase in English.


- In order to use a Voice Changer you must make a ticket and pass a voice interview using the voice changer you want to use.

 
- Our primary method of communication is voice. If you want to play someone without a voice, please make a ticket to obtain approval, and access to rp supplements in game.


- "Mute" players who wish to engage in hostile roleplay must have someone else verbally initiate a conflict or a robbery for them. They should also present hostile intent with emotes, /do commands, and other methods to show rising tension.

 
# Voice ID:
# Voice Identification Restrictions:


- When a player is wearing a face covering, you are not allowed to identify them using their voice alone. The mask must be removed to reveal their face for voice identification to be valid.


- Players can be identified through a combination of unique features such as buckles, unique guns, specific clothing sets, and other distinguishing items and features. Voice identification alone is not permitted while the player is masked, as the voice may belong to a different character played by the same person.


- Always respect a player's identity claims, even if you have suspicions otherwise.
 

# Mask Usage Rules:

- Masks used for criminal activities should only be worn when intending to commit crimes or during large-scale criminal activities such as store and bank robberies, or other law-alerting actions.


- Masks that are part of a character’s identity (e.g., a native headdress) do not need to be removed on an Out of Character (OOC) level. However, in-character laws and regulations in towns and jurisdictions must be respected and adhered to, or be prepared to face IC repercussions.


- If you wear a mask that is a significant part of your character's identity, you open yourself up to being identified by that mask. This means other players can recognize your character through this distinctive mask.
 

# Multiple Characters Consideration:

- If a player is unmasked and insists they are not the person you think they are, respect their claim and move on.
 

- Keep in mind that not all players can change their voice. Players may want to roleplay multiple characters using the same voice. Respect their choice to portray different characters even if the voice sounds familiar.
 

# Historical Context:

- Consider the historical setting of the game. Most criminals in the 1900s sought infamy rather than anonymity. This should be reflected in the roleplay dynamics regarding masks and identification.

 
# Submitting a Ticket:

- Upon review of tickets, staff will take into consideration all accounts and weigh the effect it has on future roleplay. All conclusions are at staff's discretion. 


- If you need to leave a scene early for any reason, create a ticket to inform staff after leaving. This includes your game crashing, or for any IRL reason.


- Do not stop a scene to make a ticket. Try to resolve the situation in character, and make a ticket afterwards if a rule is violated. If possible, resolve the conflict in character.


- To Submit a Ticket, find the section listed “Tickets” and use the “Open Ticket” Option. Select a ticket option that closely relates to your situation and Staff will assist as soon as possible.


- If making an anonymous player report, a bug report, or an exploit report, please have clips at the ready alongside your message, in order to address things promptly.


- Clips, or Video Recordings, are helpful to gaining context for tickets. Provide start to finish as best as possible. Edited clips, modified in an attempt to hide rule breaks or deceive staff during a ticket may result in clips being disregarded, or taken as implications towards rule breaks.

 
# Player Equipment

- Players are expected to not carry weapons beyond their means. Carry only what you can logically equip on your weapon wheel and leave the extras at home or in storage.


- Equipping a weapon from your pockets, aside from when just waking up, should be done in a logical place, such as near a storage, a horse, or a weapon case.


- If a thief takes weapons, thus putting them over the carry limit, they are expected to seek a drop point for the items stolen as soon as possible, or disperse the weapons amongst their crew to fix carry limit breaks.
 

- Players are expected to transport their items through travel. Use wagons and other methods of transport to move or deliver large amounts of items from one location to the next.


- Gatling guns, maxim guns, Hotchkiss cannons, breech cannons, and other similar weapons must be transported via wagon, and must be placed with at least three /dos of putting the weapon together at the location, and must be taken down the same way, then loaded back into the wagon and transported to a stable/hideout/home before the wagon can be fled.

 
- Unrealistic Colors on Character Hair, Horse Hair, and Horse Tack that don't meet period guidelines are up for scrutiny.

​
# Role Play Terms & Definitions:
# Harassment: 

- No harassing other players; sexual or otherwise. Anything that leads to repeat aggressive pressure or borders on intimidation on an OOC level is against the server rules. This does not mean you can avoid RP conflicts or IC consequences, but if you have tried meaningful IC resolutions and still believe you are being harassed, open a ticket and staff can help advise or mediate.


- If a ticket is shown to have been opened with malicious intent towards another party and no rule breaks are found, this will be regarded as a notable offense by staff, at their discretion.

 
# RP Bleed:

- RP Bleed is defined as taking issues, disagreements, or problems from inside RP to the Outside World, or from the Outside World into RP.


- We are not here to police your personal relationships. While we will obviously remove anyone who does not align with our goals to create a healthy, safe community, we are not interested in mediating personal disagreements between players. Do not let IC interactions impact OOC relationships. 

​
# Fail RP

- FailRP is defined as doing something unrealistic or rule breaking. Examples include but are not limited to:


- Shooting limbs off a downed player. 


- Killing NPCs without reason or engagement to justify retaliation.


- Shit talking downed bodies excessively. One or two lines, perhaps. Never more.


- Using a friend or gang member as a hostage.


- Breaking out of Sisika without Staff Approval via Ticket.


- Supernatural RP. Although this exists through rumors around 1901, situations of this nature are often disproven or explained away through illnesses, mental states, and so on.
 
​
# Metagaming:

- Metagaming is defined as using information in the game that you have not learned by playing that character, for the benefit of yourself, your character, or others in your group.


- Only use information that your character has learned while playing on the server.


- You may have streams up while playing, but they must be muted. You cannot use any information from another stream, EVER. 


- Discord messages are only usable if someone has “slipped something in your pocket” in RP such as a picture or note that they could not realistically give you in the game itself.


- When engaged in an ongoing conflict between two parties, if you have characters on both sides, you must choose which side to RP on until the conflict is resolved. This will help prevent metagaming.


- Item names and descriptions are out-of-character information unless explicitly stated as visible in game. Only use information your character would realistically be able to see or read.
 

# Example:

- You pick up a "Personal Cookbook"


- Description: "Jane's personal cookbook"


- Your character only knows it's a cookbook, not that it belongs to Jane


- You can describe its appearance (color, image) but not its ownership


Exception: If the description mentions visible text or enscriptions (e.g., "Jane's cookbook written on the front"), you can use that information in-character.

 

# Exploiting:

- The use of in-game exploits to gain advantages over other players or to give your character advantages is strictly prohibited.


- Exploiting bugs or any other cheat will result in you being banned from the server.


- If you find a bug or something that is considered an exploit, bring it to the staff's attention immediately. Not reporting this is grounds for a ban.

 
# Powergaming:

- Powergaming is defined as the act of always having to win through any means or at any cost. Powergaming includes, but is not limited to:


- Putting a camp storage or chest right next to where you are mining or farming can be powergaming if you “teleport” goods by moving your camp and skipping the use of a wagon.


- Dismissing your cart or horse to keep its inventory from getting robbed is powergaming.


- Whistling for your horse that someone stole from you to bring it back is powergaming.


- Robbing or shooting someone in any kind of menu.


- Getting on a horse while handcuffed and riding off is powergaming.


- Being AFK in an open area or on an interactable object is powergaming. If you need to leave to do something OOC, log out, or find a secure, out of the way hiding spot and return as soon as possible.


- Tackling/pushing/roping a player who has a gun pointed at you is powergaming. You would realistically be shot in the head!

- Commiting a crime and using a boat teleport within 30 minutes of said crime

- Fake deaths must be approved by the admin team through a ticket

 
# Hostile Roleplay Rules:

# Random Deathmatch (RDM):

- Random Deathmatch Consists of any intentional hostile action against a player or NPC (Non-Player Character) that is started without verbal interaction and/or roleplay buildup beforehand.


Here are some examples of RDM or Random DeathMatch:

- Randomly roping/hogtying, shooting at, stabbing and/or hitting players


- Randomly roping/hogtying, shooting at, stabbing and/or hitting of NPCs. NPCs are to be considered players and characters will be punished equally for intentionally harming NPCs as they would harming player characters.


- Planning to shoot/commit violence on sight. This topic should be avoided in RP to prevent confusion.

 

# Best practices for avoiding RDM:

- Create a scene via roleplay prior to any violence being committed, and extend vocal roleplay as much as is reasonable for the scene. This means you should be having some sort of conversation prior to any weapons being fired.
 

- Give your opponent a chance to respond verbally and prepare for their own next move
 

- Find ways to indicate imminent violence, especially if your weapon is not already drawn and pointed. Some examples of this include: using the hand on holster stance, using /me, verbally indicating you may be planning on attacking, moving into cover, etc
 

- If you have a reason to harm an NPC, roleplay the scene even if no other players are present in the immediate vicinity. This should only be done with the intention of creating roleplay, and as stated above, will likely come with in-character consequences.

 

# Fast Travel Locations:

- There are numerous mechanics that "teleport" you to another location as a form of fast travel. (Eg. Guarma Boat, Casino Boat, Apartments, and some Businesses).


- These locations should not be directly camped, instead, pick a location to intercept travel to and from these locations that allows the opposing party a chance to set themselves up and get on their feet.


# General Hostility Rules:

- Holding someone up or immediately attacking someone out of one of these exits is strictly prohibited. Allow any party exiting the ability for counterplay (to gain cover or re-enter/exit the building), as per the RDM Rules and Guidelines.


- When riding with more than 6 people in a group, the 6 active shooters must be designated before setting out for a trip


- Saint Denis and Blackwater have fully manned law offices whether you see a single player there or not.


- Do NOT rob or take hostage any player(s) that are just spawning in. Give them ample time to wake up, equip their items, and walk about as their character before engaging in hostile RP with them.


- Groups can roam around looking for trouble, or intent to attack a target, with 6 people. If you roam with masks on, you are considered “looking for trouble”. 


- Sheriffs, Lawmen, Rangers, and Marshals can defend towns with up to 12 players. They cannot chase or respond to a robbery of any kind with more than 6.


- When serving a warrant and attempting to arrest a suspect at a hideout or known gang residence, law can ride with 12 law members if approved by staff in a ticket.


- You may plan an ambush, but must not have over 6 people in total. That includes people from the original scene.


- Locals are not considered a valid hostage for negotiations.


- You cannot hold someone hostage for longer than 20 minutes before starting the robbery you have planned.


- In Hostile RP, leaving Line of Sight on your victim or aggressor for 5 minutes means the scene is considered over and proper Roleplay engagement must commence to create a new scene.

​
# Green Zones:

# Law Offices:
 

- You may not commit any form of criminal or violent RolePlay inside a law office during an arrest procedure.


- This may not be used as a “shield” for law - if an active scene is going on and the sheriff runs inside for cover during a chase etc - this voids the safe zone.

# Doctor Office:

- You may not commit any form of criminal or violent Roleplay inside a doctor's office during a Medical RP scenario.


- This may not be used as a “shield” for doctors - if an active scene is going on and the doctor runs inside for cover during a scene, etc. - this voids the safe zone.

 
# Criminal Activity / Robberies:
# In Character Consequences:

- Remand can hold you in jail for multiple days at a time but requires a serious amount of crime like anarchy charges before you obtain one


- Remand should only be applied for anarchy charges or other extreme cases as approved by a judge


- A judge can pursue a life sentence for prison in a case if significant RP has taken place to warrant it, but this must be approved by staff where a discussion is held with the player facing life in prison


- Escaping Sisika grants an automatic wanted status and means being caught will grant a remand
 

# Ropes/Bindings:

- Ropes and Bindings are powerful tools in roleplay. Players using tools to restrain others, and those properly restrained should abide by the restrictions presented here.


- Do not ragdoll or lie down to get out of any restraints.


- Do not restrain a player without proper initiation and expressed intent for the scene to advance to the use of restraints.


- Once hogtied, players should not break out of the ropes. Players should never break out of hogties while in an active scene with their captor(s), while being carried, or when on the back of a horse
​
​

- You can't break free from a hogtie unless loosened or left for 5 minutes alone and unattended.


# Criminal Activity / Robberies Cont:

- Criminals must not wear completely black clothing with no identifiable features while committing crimes. They must have at least two clearly distinguishable features, such as a buckle, bandana, distinct clothing item, firearm, horse, or saddle.

Failure to comply is a direct violation of the Voice ID rule and constitutes power-gaming, as it deliberately prevents identification, pursuit, or retaliation. This rule is strictly enforced, and violations will result in immediate consequences.

- You cannot commit any crime that involves a Law Alert 30 minutes before or 15 minutes after restart.


- Law alerts are crimes such as; grave robbing, banks, drug sales, fort robbery, law training, etc. You are still able to rob people within those time constraints.


- For any criminal activity, only 1 Lawman may be subjected to becoming a hostage.


- After a crime has been committed, you can change your clothes one time within 1 hour of said crime.


# Player Robberies:
 

- You cannot rob and kill. Pick one or the other! This includes robbing that player's horse or wagons.


- If a player fails to Value Their Life during criminal activity because of robbery rules, their protection against being shot/killed may be revoked. Staff will discern through tickets after the fact.


- The act of searching someone’s pockets means you have chosen to rob them. Only exception is to obtain the victim’s ID Card, and only their ID Card.


- The goal of robberies should be to create a story for all involved, not just for the sake of robbing.


- You can only take half of each item stack in someone's inventory. Single items can be taken.


- You can have one sidearm and one longarm protected from being robbed, carrying any more than that and it opens you up to being robbed of all weapons.


Examples: 

 - Carry a Carcano and a Revolver and those guns can't be robbed. 
 - Carry a Carcano and two revolvers and all weapons can be robbed.
 - Carry dual revolvers with no longarms, all weapons can be robbed.
 

- Do not rob new starting players of their starter money. If you were robbed of your starting cash, open a ticket.


- You must demonstrate a clear hostile intent to rob an individual and give them a chance to react


- During a robbery of any kind, each character being robbed may only be searched by ONE individual within the Criminal Group. This is to prevent taking more than half a stack or double robbing a victim. More than one player within said Criminal Group may commit robbery but they must ensure there aren't multiple people looking through a single victim's pockets.


- Backpacks and handbags can be taken, including everything inside


- Do not take property, doctor, train or law keys.


- You cannot take custom items (Eg. custom recipe books).
 

- Players may conceal carry M1899’s or a Snub-nosed Schofield without the need for a gun belt.


- Players may conceal carry any single revolver in the Left Handed Holster Position only, while also wearing a long “trench coat” style coat.


- You cannot chain rob players over and over. Robberies should include RP for both sides. Repeated, low-tier robberies within 1 hour of each other will be considered chain robbing.

 
# Train Robberies:

- Train drivers are obliged to stop the train if a wagon or ambush is placed clearly on the track

 
- Passengers should remain in the train cars and stay out of the conflict.
 

- The Security Team employed by the train company should be the group protecting the train from being robbed but can pull from passengers to make a full 6 man if needed

​
# Prison Break/Prison Transport Guidelines:

​
- When breaking someone from prison or a transport, your group should not exceed the limit of 6 including those you are breaking free. Unless the people you are breaking free remain non-combatants the entire time you have more than 6 in your group
 

- Sisika prison break attempts with larger groups can be approved by Admin.
 

# Group Robbery Limits:


-You (or your gang) can commit a “Bank Robbery”, or a “Doctor’s Office Robbery” 7 times a week, 1/day.


-You (or your gang) can commit a “Fort Robbery” or a “Dockside Robbery” 7 times a week, 1/day.


-You (or your gang) can commit a “Store Robbery” 2 times per day, with a 2 hour cooldown.


- You (or your gang) can rob a house multiple times per day, with a 2 hour cooldown.


# Underground Hideouts:

​
- Criminals raiding other hideouts should do so after there has been significant rp leading to a raid. You should know who you're raiding and have a purpose, not just blindly knocking on doors hoping for loot. Stake them out, look for patterns, learn what they're doing with it. Have some scenes before the raid, build tension, don't just hit them to hit them.


- Law also needs to put significant rp into it, investigative rp should take place. Stakeouts should happen. These aren't supposed to be, "Let's ride around with a war wagon and knock on every door we can find and see what we can get"


- Law groups and bounty hunters are not prohibited from owning a hideout, so just blindly knocking is also a bad idea in general


- Criminals raiding hideouts should limit them to 1 raid every week.


- There is no limit on quantity Law can raid, their limit is the rp required mentioned above


- Abusing the raid system for just robbing other groups without significant rp will result in the loss of your hideout without reimbursement.


- Do not start raids for 30 minutes before a restart or 15 minutes after one.
 

- Non-whitelisted gangs and groups can own 1 hideout, whitelisted gangs can have two.​ Whitelisted gangs can pick the location of their second hideout by making a ticket
 
​
# Wagon Robberies:
 
​
- You must RP with the person driving the wagon to rob it, dont just rob wagons sitting around without providing RP


- Wagons have no stack limits for robberies. Robbing the wagon means you forgo the robbery of the rider or passengers


- Wagons can be stolen and ridden away, creating a chase with the owner. In a chase when the wagon owner, law, or vigilantes catch up, they must demand the wagon to stop, announcing themselves. If the wagon refuses to stop, gunplay is now live.

 
# NVL / Fear RP 

- NVL or “No Value for Life” and Fear RP are defined as showing fear for your life in threatening situations. Treat your character’s life as if they only have one. Your character would not be fearless because you can “respawn”. Failure to value your life can result in harm to your character, so act as your character would in any and all fear inducing events.


- Value your life and the lives of those your character would value (Law with innocents/hostages, your friends and acquaintances etc).


- In 1v1 and 1v2 situations, the victim is allowed to defend themselves reasonably if they see an opening. This means, the gun is lowered or pointed away, giving you an opening. If a gun is held to you, there is no opening for you to draw. Record your gameplay!

- This does not allow firing without verbal interaction and an initial compliance and acknowledgement to the scene.


- Victims must wait 1 hour after a scene ends, before seeking interaction or revenge of any sort on their aggressors.

​
# Vigilantism:

- Vigilantism is defined as entering a hostile situation to help or save someone in trouble, while not being lawfully permitted to do so.


- Do not get involved in a store, bank or fort robbery if you are not a part of the active law or criminal group involved from the start. 


- Helping someone in the wild is doable, but comes with risk. 

 
# Body Dumping:


- Players are prohibited from dumping bodies within water.


- Do not double drop bodies, eg. dropping a body and pretending to leave hoping they call a doc then you go move them again. This is power gaming. NO EXCEPTIONS. If you need to drop a body in an unintended location even temporarily, that still counts as your drop if you step away from that body, as they assume it’s safe to call a doctor.


- You cannot camp a body waiting for a doctor to show up.


# Body Camping:

- Body Camping is the act of staying near a body in order to keep them forcefully locked in a scene and unable to call a doctor or revive after their timer is up.
 

- Once you're out of sight of the body from the downed player's perspective, or farther than yelling distance away, they have the right to respawn or call a doctor. Do not leave and come back.

​
# Permanent Harm in Torture RP:

- You must get consent from the party you plan to torture & cause permanent physical harm to. Please get consent using /do. If you torture someone this way, you are automatically consenting to be tortured in the future by that same person, not everyone.


- Psychological torture and temporary harm (ie. beatings) are not included in this.


- The person being tortured gets to pick their wounds.


- Example: “/do Clarence holds his knife to Jim’s eye, clearly wanting to cut it out, just waiting for the right moment.” In this example Clarence would need to wait for a sign from Jim to move forward.


- Without a /do in return torture cannot proceed. This automatically logs this on our end
 

 
# Corruption:

- Corruption within the DOJ and Marshals office is not allowed.

 
- Being a corrupt player of any kind, within any government-overseen position, requires whitelist approval in a ticket.


- Crime does not always equal corruption. If a character commits crimes, and is a government position, there is a chance for in-character repercussions. Corruption, when unapproved, may result in a ban if in-character repercussions are unable to be enacted.


- Approval for corruption does not allow stealing from Law or Doctor Storages, or their business ledgers.

 
# NLR (New Life Rule):

- If you have to take a local doctor (respawning / pressing E) , then your memory of the situations that led to the events of your demise are wiped.


- If a player brings you to a NPC nurse, or a player doctor revives you then nothing is forgotten unless you choose to forget.


- Someone at the scene where you were knocked unconscious can refresh your memory of what happened as long as they were never unconscious themselves.


- Do not take a local doctor (pressing E) if there are people right around you or roleplay is still ongoing at the scene you are in.

 
# Baiting

- Do not kill yourself or others to bait law or doctors to your location. Using Alerts of any Kind is also not allowed.


- Baiting through RP planning, threats, and skullduggery is viable and acceptable.


- Ambushing or Setting a Trap, so long as the Trap is in a logical location, like an Alley, a Secluded Space, or in the Wilds, is also allowed.

 
# Combat Logging:

- Logging off in the middle of any scene is not allowed.


- If a scene is making you uncomfortable or is breaking a zero tolerance rule, make a ticket straight away without breaking RP and talk with us ASAP.


- Players must stay logged in for at least 15 minutes after participating in any conflict RP. If you log out before, it will count as a combat log.

 
# Alternate Characters:

- Alternate Characters are extra characters a player can make in order to experience new stories and different aspects of the world. Characters should be unique from one another and are not allowed to be a direct relative to another character you already play. Alternate characters should strive to have unique stories that do not immediately connect with, or interact with groups or contacts of your other characters. Do not seek out the same stories, or people that your other characters already associate with, crossover in passing is acceptable, but being ingrained on multiple characters blurs the lines of RP and gives great risk to bleed.
 

- When playing a law or criminal character, there is a cooldown with the following stipulations:
 

- You cannot play as a Lawman, then log off and switch to your criminal without waiting 1 hr on your criminal before committing a crime.
 

- You cannot play a Criminal, then log off and switch to a law character without waiting 1 hr after a crime. You may switch freely without waiting if you have not committed or assisted in any crime.

​
- If you are logging off to play a Civilian character, this cooldown does not apply.


- Players with characters within the Marshals office, Rangers office or that hold the position of Sheriff are not allowed to have an alternate character within any gang. These are meant to be main character roles and should be treated as such.


- Alternate law/criminal characters cannot be in high command of either organization unless approved by Staff.


- Eg. No Law as a Sheriff/USMO/Ranger if you have a Criminal as a leader/head of a Criminal Group.


- Alternate law/criminal characters should not make the same region their home base or main area


- Eg. You can't have a criminal committing crimes in SD and a Law alt in the Saint Denis Police.


- Players cannot actively play a direct relative of another character that they play,

 
- Do not make alternate or additional characters to further the RP or storyline of your other characters. Allow storylines to happen organically and gradually. 

​
# Medical Rules:
# Injuries and Alerts:

- Injuries are common after conflict, and if you are knocked unconscious, calling a doctor may be necessary. Using /alertdoctor sends out a proximity alert to the closest doctors near you.


- You are expected to RP your injuries and wounds realistically. 


- If an injury is obtained from conflict, you must sit out of any further Hostile RP for 2 hours, to have your character recover from the wounds in a fair amount of time.


- Use of alerts (eg. “/alertdoctor”) to call docs, private practice, or law to an active scene is strictly prohibited. Do not use any alert commands while a scene is still active.
 

- After using a medical alert and seeing “A Doctor is on the Way”, give a doctor 15 minutes to try and get to you before respawning, after 15 minutes, you must take the light instead.


- If you have not been body dumped, and there is no confirmation that a doctor is responding, you must take the light when the time comes.


-  After using a doctor or private practice alert and seeing “A Doctor is on the Way”, give a doctor 15 minutes to try and get to you before respawning.
 

- Do not talk using your microphone while down, you need to respond and give doctors clues using text via "/me large cut on arm". You can make noises and sounds consistent with your wounds at any time as long as kept realistic
 

- Use /do to communicate with doctors. If you cannot see the /do commands, use the T Chatbox, or have the doctor stabilize you, and continue medical RP through voice.
 

- Typing “no pulse” or “dead” means you are permanently killing off your character. Doctors can attempt to restart your heart only one time. You must delete your character when you do this or we will do it for you.
 

- You are not allowed to lie about treatment you received from a doctor when being inspected by other doctors.
 

- Contracting a disease like TB, Pneumonia or other diseases that would result in death in 1901, will result in a perma-death of your character within a timeframe of your choosing. You get to choose if you contract these or not, so be careful.
 

- Players that are down for a period exceeding 30 minutes within an active scene where doctors, law or other medical practitioners are on scene and not reviving you or providing full medical treatment are allowed to revive. All usual New Life Rules still apply.
 

# Injury Guidelines:

- As a helpful guide to assist with Role Playing injuries to varying magnitudes, we have provided the following table for day/time conversions between IRL and Server Days.

 
# Time/Day Converter for County Days:

1 Day IC = 60 Minutes IRL

1 Week IC = 7 hrs IRL

 

# Private Practice Doctors:

- All distribution of revive medication and smelling salts must be documented in the proper channels. There are no private sales of these meds, and none are given for free. It is for server health that it is tracked. Any violation of this will result in OOC consequences, as well as Roleplay-oriented IC consequences.

 
# Outlaw Doctors:

- Outlaw doctors can rob cash or one item, up to a half stack, from a player they provide treatment to, are in a medical scene with, or revive. This is allowed even within the robbing cooldown by an outlaw doctor only. All other standard robbery rules still apply. This is how outlaw doctors get paid.

​
- You cannot call a third-party outlaw doctor to have someone robbed that you or your gang have killed. You can call them to treat them and continue rp, but the downed victims shouldn't be robbed as it can gain favor with whoever called them in. The od should be paid by the gang or group that called them

​
- If a patient refuses to pay or fails to Value their Life, the Outlaw Doctor is allowed to terminate the scene how they see fit.

​
- Private Practices and the CMO are not Outlaw Doctors and are prohibited from acting as such.

​
- Should the patient be knocked unconscious after the Outlaw Doctor has revived them once already, the scene has concluded. No repeat revives are allowed, even in the event of NVL after treatment. Leave the body, or dump

 
# Pregnancy RP and Aging:

- Every aspect of pregnancy and family RP needs to be clearly agreed upon by both parents involved and consented to before any RP involving Pregnancy happens. This means the length of time they wish to RP it out, the number of children, etc.

​
# Players interested in Roleplaying a Pregnancy must abide by the following guidelines:

- Pregnancy has a minimum duration of 3 Weeks. Do not roleplay pregnancy loss. 

​
- After 3 weeks of Pregnancy RP, the child cannot be played by another player until an additional 3 week period has passed to reflect the child becoming 18. These 6 Weeks total are referred to as a Complete Cycle of Pregnancy RP.

​
- After a Complete Cycle of Pregnancy RP, the player must wait an additional 2 week period before a new cycle of Pregnancy RP may commence.

​
- Parents can never play as their own children, unless both parents have died. Another Player may play the child, once the child is 18 years of age.

 
- Upon the child becoming playable, the parents (and any elder children in the immediate family) agree to age themselves up to reflect the age of the child. This means the first child will result in an 18 year increase to the parents, and any further children result in however many additional years between the most recent child, and the newborn.


- If you have your baby or child with you, either in the womb, or on your person, or beside you in character no crimes should be committed by you, and no conflicts should be engaged with. This is considered NVL.


- Pregnancy is not a shield; you can still be shot/knocked unconscious, but the child cannot be targeted or lost as a result.

​
- A woman with a baby can be robbed, but harming the child in any way is a permanent server ban.

​
- Child murder/torture, or even threats of such, are never allowed even when still in the womb.

 
# Gang Rules:

- Make your gang known to the staff if you want gang privileges via a ticket. Non-whitelisted gangs are limited to a maximum of 12 people.


- Gangs can have more than 12 members if whitelisted

​
- Gangs get access to 1 gang-themed drug after whitelist approval, and 3-4 months of solid RP. Include a proposal for your gang drug in your gang whitelist ticket for future reference.


- Gangs can defend their home base with any number up to a maximum of 12, any reservists must remain non-combatants. 

 
- 12 v 12 is allowed only when a ticket with staff is made and approved with both party leaders law vs gang or gang vs gang and staff.

 
# Gang Strikes:

- Every gang is limited to 3 active gang strikes. After receiving 3 gang strikes, a gang will lose all gang privileges, such as:
 

- Their main hideout that they chose to defend with 12 players. 
 

- They lose any and all access to their chosen whitelisted drug. 
 

- Custom gang discord tag revoked.
 

- To receive a gang strike a minimum of 3 members of the gang/group must have been involved in a scene with anyone in their gang committing a rule break. A single strike falls off after 30 days of no additional Gang Strikes issued.
 

- If the player with the active strike is permanently removed from the gang, the strike no longer counts for the gang, but does follow the character.
 

- More than 5 total accumulated strikes = dissolvement of gang
​
 
# Miscellaneous Rules:


# Law & Politics:

 
- In all regions, characters cannot hold both a position in law/army and a government position. If elected or appointed the character is required to resign. A region is defined as the USA, Mexico, and Guarma. Jurisdictions within these regions would apply to this rule as well.

​
# Sisika Roleplay:

- Do not break into Sisika to sell goods, perform jobs, or engage in similar activities. This is a maximum-security institution, and unannounced visitors will be treated as a serious security threat. Realistically, this would result in being shot or otherwise severely dealt with. This will be considered as a No Value for Life rulebreak.


- Attacking Guards or Lawmen within Sisika without justification—such as self-defense or a valid roleplay scenario—will also be considered an NVL rulebreak. Sisika is a high-security prison, and any unwarranted aggression against officials inside its grounds is treated as an extreme disregard for life.

​
# Smuggling:

- Smuggling only to happen at night, into the secret Dead Drop location.


- Only items and item parts can be smuggled into prison, no weapons or firearms.


- Prisoner Chests and storage that are not Warden Controlled will be searched at any time.


- Chests and Storage hidden around Sisika will be destroyed, no questions asked.


# Prison Breaks:

- Prison breaks remain only approved via ticket.


- Only a maximum of 2 prisoners can break out at a time.


- Breakouts must be backed by at least 3 weeks of prep and planning that will be reviewed for story validity by Staff in their breakout ticket.  

​

# Businesses and Homes:
​

- Staff reserves the right to remove your business due to inactivity. Make a ticket if you are on an extended trip, or concerned regarding business repossession.
 

- If the business is inactive, or players have not logged in for a period of 3 weeks (21 days), staff will repossess your business, UNLESS you have submitted a ticket to explain your situation to staff regarding an extended absence.
 

- Employees, and Criminals, cannot steal from business storages or ledgers.


- Before selling a business IC you need to make a ticket to obtain its max sell value. Not complying with this will result in removal of business and may prevent future ownership of new businesses


- If someone has you hogtied and wants your “key” to your built door, you must open the door for them. 
 

- Players are limited to One Business per player. You may not own multiple businesses and have managers run them.
​

- Players are limited to One Home per Player. Alternate characters can live within homes, but players cannot own more than 1 home.
 

- Multiple businesses may be owned by a family or a group, each with their own unique owners per business.



# Multi Job Rules

- You cannot have two jobs that earn a government paycheck, maximum 2 jobs per character


- Do not complete your own supply chains, ie. blacksmiths should go to a carpenter for supplies instead of using multijob to craft both carpenter and blacksmith items.


- Players are not allowed to have more than one character in the same line of work.


# Tailor Mannequin Script Rules:

- The tailor mannequin script enhances roleplay by allowing tailors to craft outfits. Use must prioritize immersion, historical accuracy, and meaningful roleplay.

- Tailors must ensure outfits are period-appropriate, non-offensive, and immersion-friendly. **Nudist, sexually explicit, or inappropriate clothing (per No NSFW policy) is banned from distribution.** Violations may lead to loss of script access or privileges.

- **Niche Clothing:** Items like belly dancer attire or unusual pieces (e.g., turtle shells, bloodied suits) are restricted to characters with relevant historical/roleplay context and require staff approval. Misuse is punishable.

- **Restricted Items:** Black KKK hoods, nudist/inappropriate attire, and extreme immersion-breaking items are prohibited. Other restricted pieces require staff approval via ticket for specific use.

- **Access:** Script is job-locked to tailors; higher ranks may access niche items with approval. It supplements, not replaces, the existing crafting system for small items.

- **Roleplay:** Mid-scene Outfit changes need IC justification. Excessive use without context is Fail RP.


# Gilded RP Animal PED Rules:
# General rules:


- You must act as your chosen PED animal would realistically behave. Domesticated animals will be more willing to be around humans, wild animals will be afraid of almost all humans.


- No talking as an animal. Animals do not talk. You can mute your mic in TeamSpeak to avoid accidental talking.


- Animals do not understand complex language and cannot read. Domesticated animals, such as dogs/cats, will understand simple commands such as sit, stay, follow. Wild animals will understand even less.


- Animal PEDs currently have unlimited stamina due to script limitations. You must RP some form of exhaustion, not doing so is powergaming. -Do not use “human” food or drink, or use any of the usual player emotes. These are not calibrated to be used with animal PEDs. This includes putting your hands up with “X”. Keep the use of /scenetop and /scenebottom simple. Etc, “Red Collar”.


- Rabies and other animal diseases must have consent


# Ped Combat rules:

- You cannot attack unprovoked, that is still considered RDM. Ensure that there is adequate RP beforehand, for example a dog would growl and bark, a cat would hiss and puff its tail. There are physical things you can /do to show warning of an attack.


- If cornered/threatened, you may attack ONCE and then retreat. You cannot attack again for a minimum of 30 seconds.


# Additional Law Dog rules:

- Only one Lawdog can be involved in a scene.
